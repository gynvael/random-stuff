Solution
========

The pcap contains USB packets generated by a gamepad (technically it was a Nintendo Switch gamepad connected via USB). There are quite a lot of packets, but most of them are irrelevant. You also get an `app.html` HTML5 application which is basically an on-screen keyboard with a text field to be used with a gamepad.

To solve the task:
1. Analyze `app.html` to learn that it uses only 6 buttons and that it has a pretty strict debouncing mechanism (this is to make it easier for the players to get the flag).
2. Extract the button presses/releases from the pcap.
3. Ideally just play back the events in `app.html` - this requires a couple of lines of code if you hook in the right place.
4. Read the flag from app's screen.
