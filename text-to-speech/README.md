# Text file to MP3 converter (using Google Cloud API)

**Fair warning - this is a very simple hacked up script.**

**Use at your own risk.**

**And expect to have to fix stuff.**

And it uses Google Cloud API, so you'll need both enabled text-to-speech API
and a generated role account. See [text-to-speech quick start guide](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-protocol).

You'll also need [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
