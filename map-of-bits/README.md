== Map of Bits (levels 0-3) && Revenge of Bits (levels 4-6) BMP stegano challenges!

I really hope you like BMP file format and general bitmap stegano. Since we all
hate guessing: levels 0 and 1 are image (data) stegano, and level 2+ are file
format stegano.

Note: Here are the first 2 and last 2 letters of the flag in each level to
minimize guessing (length is unspecified):

```
level 0: 48............a2
level 1: cx............bt
level 2: 7n...........cs
level 3: DrgnS{On.............s!}
level 4: w1............p3
level 5: qf............lr
level 6: DrgnS{Mo.............!!}
```
